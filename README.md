# 🏅 Sports Classification

## 📘 Overview

This project aims to build an AI/ML model that accurately classifies sports images into predefined categories such as basketball, soccer, tennis, and more. It leverages a structured image dataset and focuses on developing a robust classification pipeline that generalizes well across different image conditions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

1. Preprocess and explore the sports image dataset
2. Develop and train a classification model capable of distinguishing between different sports
3. Evaluate model performance using test and validation data
4. Improve classification accuracy and generalizability across varied image conditions

## 📁 Dataset

**Download Link:** [sports.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meCVPigiH1dR50CxxIXZ3mtQy_VwgWUx/view?usp=drive_link)

The dataset is organized into three primary subfolders:

```
train/
test/
validation/
```
Each of these contains subdirectories labeled by sport name (e.g., basketball/, soccer/, tennis/), and each subdirectory holds relevant images of that particular sport.
